In this folder, there will be some examples from [brian2 example espcially frompapers.](https://brian2.readthedocs.io/en/stable/examples/index.html)<br>

Actually, It is amzing for me that the py code with brian2 is so short but strong. I mean, the code I used to write in C/C++ was usually too long.<br>
Therefore, as the slogan of brian2 is said, it really helps the scientists save time.

* Balanced networks from Vogels et al(2011)<br>

The first one is from Vogels relating to balanced network, of which title is [Inhibitory plasticity balances excitation and inhibition in sensory
pathways and memory networks](http://science.sciencemag.org/content/334/6062/1569.long) published in `Science` on 2011. I want to know how to code the network with exactly balanced excitatory and inhibitory synaptic current,
which I think is very important to neural information coding and propagation.
